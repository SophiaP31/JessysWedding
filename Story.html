<h2>  Our story </h2>

  Matt and I both went to West Springfield High School. Although we both were on the track and field team, we never actually knew more than each others’ names. To be honest, this was not abnormal because I was a sprinter and Matt was a distance runner and I’ll just go ahead and say it, distance boys are weird. All of those strange stories you probably heard about the distance kids at your school?... yeah they are all probably true. But anyways, we both ended up on the same Relay for Life team in May of our Sophomore year of high school. On a team of over 50 people, Matt was the only person I didn’t know.
  <br>
  <br>
  To say it was “love at first sight” would be a gross inaccuracy. In fact, at this time Matt probably weighed less than me, despite the 2 foot height advantage. He was an incredibly thin, spaghetti-armed teen boy and I was an equally awkward frizzy-haired girl myself. So, no, we did not fall in love the moment we locked eyes on one another. However, he introduced himself as we walked a lap together with the entire team and we began to talk and continued to walk another lap, and then another and another, until it was just us left walking around the track for hours. I no longer remember what we talked about, but I remember thinking that something felt right. At the end of the very long night, he asked for my phone number and that led to us hanging out all summer getting to know each other.
<br>
<br>
  We then started dating on October 26th 2012 just after we attended junior year Homecoming together. Matt and I were a teenage relationship anomale: no drama, no on-again, off-again cycle. We didn’t fight then and we still don’t. This is not on account of me. It’s 100% because Matt is an incredibly patient man. My life changed when Matt came into it and he is the single best thing that has ever happened to me. I still think about how lucky we are to have found our soul mates so early in life. In fact, I knew way back in high school that Matt was the man I would marry. Of course, I didn’t actually tell him that then because he probably would have ran in the other direction, but hey, maybe it was just my female intuition.
<br>
<br>
  After graduating in 2014, I went to Virginia Tech and Matt attended East Carolina University. We decided to “break up” going into college, so we would be able to experience college on our own and pave our own paths in life. Well, we did a pretty bad job of “breaking up” and went to visit each other every three weeks anyways. After three months, we were official yet again.
<br>
<br>
  Second semester of college was one of the most difficult, but also most rewarding times in our relationship. Matt went to Basic Training for four months. He had no access to any type of electronic communication, so we wrote letters instead. We wrote almost two letters a week the entire time he was gone. I would get so excited to get letters from Matt that I literally learned the exact time the mailman came and I would run down from my dorm to ask the mailman if he had any mail for me before
  he even had a chance to put it in my mailbox. Although it took us several years to find this out, Matt and I both saved every letter we ever received.
<br>
<br>
  Throughout college, we visited each other as much as possible, despite neither of us having cars freshman year and me not having a car all four years. We made it work by catching rides with other people and often meeting halfway. I wouldn’t even be able to guess the amount of times someone told me “I could never do long distance for that long,” and my response was always the same, “if it was the right person, you would.” During summer, winter, and spring breaks we spent as much time together as possible and did some pretty amazing things. We were able to go to Yellowstone, the Rockies, the Grand Tetons, Shenandoah, The Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, the Smoky mountains, Zion National Park, and a ton of trips to the lake house. We have also had some amazing trips to meet each other in Steinhatchee, FL and Valdosta, GA. Oh, never heard of those places before? It’s okay most people in Florida have not either. It just happens to be the half-way point between Tampa and Ft Rucker. The only
  thing there is a dollar general (referred to as the grocery store by the locals) and a 100 ft beach that instantly turns to a marsh with dirty water and no waves. The point is, no matter where we are and what we are doing, if we are together we will have a blast.
<br>
<br>
  When we first started going to the lake back in high school, we used to anchor the pontoon boat and spend the night camping on it. We would stay up for hours just talking about everything that mattered to us. In fact, it was those nights in high school gazing up at the stars where I believe I really fell in love.
<br>
<br>
  After we graduated, I moved to Tampa for my Dietetic internship and Matt came to Ft. Rucker for Flight School. Luckily, we both have cars now so it’s easier to meet up on the weekends. I still despise long distance though and cannot wait for it to end. We are excited to start our life together soon and can’t wait to see where our next adventure will takes us - hopefully living under the same roof!

<h2>  Proposing to Jessy…</h2>

	Jessy and I talked about getting married and our wedding all the time, from where we wanted to be, to how we wanted to live our lives together. There was really no surprise to Jessy, our friends, or our family that Jessy and I were eventually getting married. “Eventually” being the key word here because Jessy thought it would never happen. When she joked that at the 8 year mark of us dating she would move on, I replied with “well, I’m a patient person, so we will see what happens”.
<br>
<br>
  Over the summer, I started more seriously considering how and when I should ask her, knowing that we wanted to move in together after her internship and definitely be married before I left flight school. The search for rings began… i’m not a jewelry person nor do I know anything about fashion so this was an interesting process. Turns out there are about a million choices and I had no idea where to start because they all just looked like shiny circles to me. So, I had some friends send me ideas from Jessy’s pinterest and I started to narrow it down. Then it just came down to finding the perfect ring (to my best judgement). Finally, I saw it in a jewelry store and knew that I had found the one. After sending some pictures and getting confirmation from her friends, it was a done deal. I was leaving with the perfect ring and way more knowledge about cuts, clarity, and carats than I ever thought I would have.
<br>
<br>
  Now it was time to ask! Only problem was, I am in Alabama, she's in Florida and all of our friends and family are in Virginia. The only time in the foreseeable future that we would all be in the same place was Christmas break. However, Jessy hates the cold and I know she would want me to ask her outside somewhere nice or on the top of a mountain. After having adjusted to Tampa weather, Jessy thought 60 degrees was cold, so a hike in Virginia in winter was out. Not only would she have not wanted to go out on the hike, but if she did and we got to the top and I asked here there, it would have taken her about 15 minutes to take all the gloves off her hands to put a ring on. That might have been enough time to contemplate her answer, and I didn’t want to take any chances.
<br>
<br>
	I decided I would ask at the lake where we have so many fond memories and would be able to coordinate asking outside and having her friends surprise her. The plan was that our families would plan a trip down there for a night and I would have her friends show up to the house while I was down by the water with Jessy asking one of the most important questions of my life.
<br>
<br>
Of course, nothing goes as simple as the plan. While driving down to the lake we hit a lot of traffic (Jessy’s favorite). After seeing our arrival time to the lake slowly growing later and later, Jessy started suggesting that we turn around and not go to the lake or just go a different day. This really tested my skills of being able to convince her that going 10 mph in traffic wasn’t that bad and it would be worth it. Finally, we arrived at the lake and I started coordinating with her friends, who were not far behind in traffic, where to wait for Jessy and I to walk down to the water. One of her friends showed up to the actual house and ended up hiding in my Dad’s truck until Jessy and I could get out of the house. I recommended a walk down to the water to everyone and Jessy was in (phew). She didn’t understand why everyone was taking so long to get ready, so we started our walk down and decided everyone could “catch up with us later”. On the walk down, Jessy mentioned that she didn't think she would have anything to drink tonight (as about a group of 13 was waiting excitedly at the house with champagne - she thought wrong). Anyway, we got to the perfect spot and after a quick talk, I asked her to marry me and she said YES! After that, we turned around to walk back up to the house where our friends and family had come out on the deck to help welcome us back and celebrate our engagement.
